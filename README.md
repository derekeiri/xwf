A collection of configuration or definition files.

**Reg Report DDPE.txt** retrieves the Machine ID (MCID) and Shield ID (DCID) required to decrypt files using Dell Data Protection Encryption and saved as an HTML report. Also reports the Dell Server URI. DDPE policies vary by organization, which may include encryption of registry hive files. Will not work if policy enforces encryption of the SOFTWARE registry hive. Tested with XWF 20.7 SR-2. <br><br>
